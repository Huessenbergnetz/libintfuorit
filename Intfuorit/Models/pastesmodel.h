 * It contains a std::vector of pointers to Paste objects taht are children of
 * the PastesModel. Destroying the PastesModel will also destroy the Paste objects
 * in it. Internally this model uses GetPastesForAccount to request a list of pastes
 * a specific account is part of from the HIBP API and to populate the model.
 *
 * Call getPastesForAccount() to start the API request and to populate the model. See
 * also BaseModel for more information about required settings.
 *
 * Do not use this class directly, use one of the derived classes, as this class does
 * not implement all functions from QAbstractItemModel that are needed.
